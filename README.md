Business Intelligence dashboard using Microsoft Power BI for a hypothetical bicycle sales franchise called Adventure Works

#
Adventure Works is a bicycle sales shop that wanted insights on their business performance, so Microsoft Power BI was used to create a fully interactive dashboard that tracks and updates automatically over time.

Data was modelled from scratch using sales and customer data stored in csv files. The data required transformation using the query editor, along with the creation of several useful columns.
In addition, DAX measures were heavily used to combine information from various tables to provide insights on customers behaviour, and product performances.
